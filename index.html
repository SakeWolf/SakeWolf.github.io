			<h1><i class="fa fa-fast-backward color-D0088A"></i> Noccy's Favorite Albums of 2015</h1>
			<p>At the start of 2015, one of the resolutions I had set myself was to better educate myself on modern music and what it had to offer, both to broaden my own appreciation of a craft I love and to better be able to discuss and share my findings with my friends. As such, by the end of this expedition over a 120 albums had passed through my tired old headphones, and even though I still missed a handful of the bigger releases of the year I found myself enjoying (or at least appreciating) the vast majority of the records I checked out. Of course though, a handful of albums stood out above the rest and lured me back to indulge in them over and over again, so in commemoration of this crazy ride: here are my 25 favorite albums I listened to in 2015!</p>

			<p>All in all, this year was super awesome for music! 2016 is already shaping up to be a good year, so I'll be looking forward to continuing this and seeing if I can't finally get that blog off the ground.</p>
